To visualize your **disease–gene knowledge graph** in **Neo4j Browser**, you can use a simple Cypher query like this:

```cypher
MATCH (d:Disease)-[r:ASSOCIATES_WITH]->(g:Gene)
RETURN d, r, g
LIMIT 100;
```

### Explanation:

* `MATCH (d:Disease)-[r:ASSOCIATES_WITH]->(g:Gene)`
  Finds all diseases (`d`) connected to genes (`g`) via the relationship `ASSOCIATES_WITH`.
* `RETURN d, r, g`
  Returns nodes and relationships so Neo4j Browser can visualize them as a graph.
* `LIMIT 100`
  Prevents the graph from overloading your screen with too many nodes.

### Alternative visualization queries:

If you want to explore different parts of the graph:

1. **All diseases and related genes**

   ```cypher
   MATCH (d:Disease)-[:ASSOCIATES_WITH]->(g:Gene)
   RETURN d, g
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

2. **Single disease focus**

   ```cypher
   MATCH (d:Disease {name: "Asthma"})-[r:ASSOCIATES_WITH]->(g:Gene)
   RETURN d, r, g;
   ```

3. **Genes connected to multiple diseases**

   ```cypher
   MATCH (g:Gene)<-[:ASSOCIATES_WITH]-(d:Disease)
   WITH g, count(d) AS numDiseases
   WHERE numDiseases > 2
   MATCH (g)<-[r:ASSOCIATES_WITH]-(d)
   RETURN g, r, d
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

4. **Interactive exploration (start with one disease)**

   ```cypher
   MATCH (d:Disease {name: "Diabetes"})-[r*1..2]-(n)
   RETURN d, r, n;
   ```

   This explores up to two levels of relationships from the disease "Diabetes."

Would you like me to help you write a **custom query** that matches how your dataset is structured (e.g., `Disease`, `Gene`, `Pathway`, etc.)?
If you paste a few sample node labels and relationship types from your Neo4j database (`CALL db.schema.visualization();` output), I can tailor the exact Cypher query for you.
